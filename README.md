### Title:
**Node.js Application**

### Description:
This repository contains a simple Node.js application built using the Express.js framework. The application serves as a starting point for developers looking to build web applications using Node.js. Additionally, it includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for AWS ECS/Fargate deployment and a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for seamless deployment.

### Features:
- **Hello World Endpoint:** The application responds with "Hello World!" when accessed via the root route (`/`).
- **Easy Setup:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners and experienced developers alike.
- **Flexible Configuration:** The application can be easily configured to listen on different ports or serve additional routes as needed.
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment:** Infrastructure for deploying the Node.js application is automated using Terraform, ensuring scalability and high availability by leveraging AWS ECS/Fargate.
- **Continuous Deployment Pipeline:** The project includes a Continuous Deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions, automating the deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

### Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Terraform
- AWS ECS/Fargate
- GitHub Actions

### Installation:
